Parallel Configuration - Graph-mode parallel configuration.

Pure configuration dataclass: no environment probes. Whether FSDP actually
runs is decided by ``fsdp_enabled`` here (the user's intent) AND the runtime
distributed guard inside ``FSDPPass`` (which still early-returns on
``world_size == 1``). The previous ``fsdp_enabled`` property returned
``dist.is_initialized() and world_size > 1`` — that turned on FSDP whenever
distributed was initialized, leaving no way to run pure-TP / pure-PP graph
mode. The explicit field fixes that. Pipeline-parallel (``pp_enabled``)
follows the same contract: intent here, runtime guard in ``PpPass``.

@dataclass
class PassConfig:
    """Parallel configuration for graph-mode FSDP (+ optional TP / SP / PP) training.

    Attributes:
        enable_overlap: Drive ``AutoOverlapPass`` to move ``wait_tensor`` for
            communication/compute overlap.
        fsdp_enabled: Drive ``FSDPPass`` (parameter all_gather + gradient
            reduce_scatter + live-model sharding). ``False`` skips FSDP
            entirely — set this for pure-TP / pure-PP graph-mode runs.
            ``FSDPPass`` itself still early-returns when distributed is not
            initialized or ``world_size == 1``, so single-card runs are a
            no-op regardless.
        fsdp_degree: Size of the FSDP group. ``None`` (default) means
            "resolve at runtime": the trainer back-fills it from the
            automodel ``MeshContext`` (TP+FSDP hybrid, where the FSDP group
            is a proper sub-group of the world), and ``FSDPPass`` falls back
            to ``world_size`` for the FSDP-only path. Mutating this after
            construction is supported but discouraged — prefer passing the
            resolved degree at construction time (see ``GraphTrainer``).
        tp_size: Tensor-parallel degree. Informational today (TP collectives
            live inside boundary forwards baked by automodel, not in the
            graph-mode passes); kept so a future TP-aware pass can read it
            without API churn.
        sequence_parallel: Enable sequence parallel (SP) on the TP axis.
        loss_parallel: Enable loss parallel (LP) on the TP axis.
        pp_enabled: Drive ``PpPass`` (pipeline-parallel graph split). When
            ``True`` the joint fwd+bwd graph is sliced to this rank's stage
            along module-FQN boundaries declared in ``GraphParallelPlan``, cross-stage
            activations are exchanged via P2P ``isend``/``irecv``, and a
            self-contained GPipe schedule is installed as a ``call_module``
            stub inside the rewritten graph, so the trainer needs no PP
            wiring. ``PpPass`` early-returns when distributed is not
            initialized or ``world_size == 1``.
        pp_degree: Number of pipeline-parallel ranks (== number of stages
            for the single-virtual-stage schedule shipped here). ``None``
            means "resolve at runtime" from ``world_size`` (the pure-PP
            path); for a PP+FSDP hybrid the FSDP group is a proper
            sub-group of the world and the trainer back-fills this from
            the mesh, exactly like ``fsdp_degree``.
        pp_microbatch_size: Number of samples per microbatch for the GPipe
            schedule. The per-step batch size (the leading dim of the
            trainer's input tensor) must be divisible by this. ``1`` means
            one sample per microbatch (maximum pipeline concurrency, most
            P2P traffic); larger values trade bubble size for fewer P2P
            round-trips.

    Note:
        ``fsdp_enabled`` / ``pp_enabled`` no longer probe
        ``torch.distributed``. The distributed-initialized check moved into
        the respective passes' ``run`` (their original location) so this
        dataclass stays torch-free and importable anywhere.

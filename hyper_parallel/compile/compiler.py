"""
Graph Compiler - compile a model into a parallel graph and run fwd+bwd.

Compiler surface of the graph-mode stack:

- ``compile`` traces the model into a joint forward+backward FX graph and
  runs the partitioning passes (FSDP / PP / overlap) on it.
- ``forward_backward`` executes the compiled graph against the live model
  state and deposits gradients into ``param.grad`` (accumulating, so several
  micro-batch calls may run before the caller's optimizer step).

Training-policy concerns (optimizer, dataloader loop, logging, batch device
placement) are deliberately out of scope: ``GraphTrainer`` composes this
class and owns them.

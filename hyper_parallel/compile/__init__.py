HyperParallel Graph Mode - Graph-mode architecture for HyperParallel

Graph-mode architecture for automatic parallelization.

Core Features:
- Users write model code + parallel configuration
- Framework automatically handles all parallel logic
- Graph capture → Parallel partitioning → Communication-compute overlap → Execution

Usage Example:
    from hyper_parallel.compile import (
        GraphCompiler,
        GraphParallelPlan,
        GraphTrainer,
        PassConfig,
    )

    # Create model
    model = Llama3ForCausalLM(config)

    # Configure parallelism
    pass_config = PassConfig(enable_overlap=True)

    # Build parallel plan
    parallel_plan = GraphParallelPlan()
    parallel_plan.fsdp_mark_pattern("layers.*")

    # Compile + forward_backward only (no optimizer / training loop); model
    # inputs travel as kwargs, forwarded to train_fn(model, **inputs):
    compiler = GraphCompiler(model, train_fn, pass_config, parallel_plan)
    compiler.compile(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels)
    loss = compiler.forward_backward(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels)  # grads -> param.grad

    # Or drive the whole train/optimize loop -- the trainer composes a
    # GraphCompiler, compiles on the first batch, moves each input dict onto
    # its device, and owns the optimizer. data_iterable yields input dicts:
    trainer = GraphTrainer(model, train_fn, pass_config, parallel_plan)
    trainer.train(dataloader, max_steps=100, log_interval=10)

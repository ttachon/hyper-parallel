Graph Pass Base - Base Class for Graph Transformation Passes

All parallel partitioning passes and optimization passes inherit from this
class. The config a pass receives is typed as ``PassConfig`` so passes
can rely on ``enable_overlap`` / ``fsdp_enabled`` / ``fsdp_degree``
/ ``tp_size`` being present without each pass re-declaring the contract.

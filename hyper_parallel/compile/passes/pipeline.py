Pass Pipeline - Pass Orchestrator

Automatically builds Pass execution order based on parallel configuration.

Execution Order:
1. Basic optimization: DeadCodeElimination, CanonicalizeGraph
2. Execution layer:
   - FSDPPass (FSDP)
   - PpPass (pipeline-parallel stage split) — runs AFTER FSDPPass: the FSDP
     collectives are value-level FX nodes that follow the data flow, so the
     stage slices inherit this stage's all_gather/reduce_scatter untouched
     while foreign stages' collectives are simply never copied. Splitting
     first would hand FSDPPass two subgraphs and a loss-less output list,
     breaking its grad-index contract.
3. Communication-compute overlap: AutoOverlapPass (a no-op under PP — the
   stage stub carries no wait_tensor nodes; the GPipe schedule overlaps
   comm/compute at the Python level)

The backend compilation slot (InductorPass) is intentionally not wired yet;
add it here when an inductor backend integration lands.

    """The MPipe Transpose schedule.

    A variant of Interleaved 1F1B that shrinks the warmup pipeline bubble by
    **transposing** the forward of a model's first ``T`` layers (the
    *preprocess* block, which logically belongs to stage 0's first chunk).

    Instead of stage 0 computing the preprocess forward serially for every
    micro-batch, the preprocess parameters are broadcast to all ``PP`` ranks
    and, for the first ``NT = min(PP, micro_batch_num)`` micro-batches, each
    rank ``i`` computes the preprocess forward of micro-batch ``i`` in parallel
    during what would otherwise be its warmup idle time.  Each rank ``i > 0``
    then ships to stage 0:

      * the preprocess **output** (``MPIPE_FWD_SEND`` / ``MPIPE_FWD_RECV``) so
        stage 0 can run its body forward, and
      * the preprocess **input** (``MPIPE_GRAPH_SEND`` / ``MPIPE_GRAPH_RECV``)
        so the preprocess backward can run centrally on stage 0
        (gradients accumulate on stage 0 only).

    The remaining ``micro_batch_num - NT`` micro-batches run the preprocess
    forward inline on stage 0 (graph-connected to the body, so their backward
    is automatic), exactly as ordinary Interleaved 1F1B.

    The body model (stage 0 = the layers after the preprocess block, all other
    stages unchanged) is scheduled by the inherited Interleaved 1F1B logic; the
    preprocess steps are layered around it: a transpose-phase prefix per rank,
    plus inline preprocess forward / stage-0 backward steps.

    Args:
        stages (list[PipelineStage], PipelineStage): The body pipeline stages,
            given **after** stage 0's first chunk has been partitioned into the
            preprocess block and the body.  Stage 0 here must wrap only the
            layers that remain *after* the preprocess block; the transposed
            preprocess layers are passed separately as ``preprocess_module`` and
            must not appear in ``stages``.
        micro_batch_num (int): The number of micro-batches.
        preprocess_module (Optional[Module]): The preprocess block (first ``T``
            layers of stage 0).  Following Option A, it must exist on **every** rank: on rank 0
            it holds the trained parameters; on other ranks it is a structural
            copy whose parameters are overwritten each step by the broadcast.
        num_transpose_layers (int): ``T`` — the number of preprocess layers,
            must be smaller than the layer count of stage 0's first chunk.
            ``0`` is allowed and means *only the data loading is transposed*:
            each rank loads its micro-batch and ships the raw input to stage 0,
            with no parameter broadcast, no preprocess compute, and no
            stage-0 backward.
        args_batch_dim (list, optional): See ``PipelineScheduleRuntime``.
        kwargs_batch_dim (dict, optional): See ``PipelineScheduleRuntime``.

        overlap_p2p (bool, optional): See ``ScheduleInterleaved1F1B``.
            Default ``False``.
        swap (bool, optional): Reserved for API compatibility. MPipe activation
            swap is not supported and ``True`` raises ``ValueError``.

    Note:
        This class builds the schedule ordering and registers the ``MPIPE_*``

        receives every non-owned micro. For a **trainable** preprocess every

        additionally ship the input for the centralized stage-0 backward; for

        every stage-0 BWD (the preprocess output is detached either way).

        Under ``"min"``: rank 0 absorbs the overflow micros ``NT..M-1``. Before
        each stage-0 FWD on an overflow micro we insert DATA_LOAD and (under
        trainable or frozen) MPIPE_TRANSPOSE_FWD — running the preprocess
        locally with a detached graph. For frozen this is just "rank 0
        runs the ViT here so the body forward has the encoded features /
        visual-injection kwarg"; for trainable the body BWD also needs an
        MPIPE_TRANSPOSE_BWD stage-0 backward for the preprocess gradient. (The
        previous design used a graph-connected forward to avoid the
        stage-0 backward on overflow micros; that optimization isn't restored
        here — `"min"` saves comm for slightly more rank-0 compute on the

        inline here, since the blocking grad meta-exchange would deadlock against
        the body's P2P. So no per-BWD step is inserted for any micro; every
        owned/inline forward on stage 0 already runs graph-connected
        (``transpose_forward``'s owner-backward branch), so the body backward
        flows into the tower automatically.

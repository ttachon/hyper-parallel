"""Op records: what each op of a layer keeps for its backward, as data (shared decision S1).

``op_records.yaml`` states, for every op of the op vector, the recompute
switch that drops it, if any, the ops whose outputs recomputing it takes,
and whether it is communication; the *parts* of an op's saves that a switch
of their own drops, each named for the op it is part of; and, for each of the
memory model's activation formulas, a *slot*, the formula and the elements
each of its ops and parts keeps.  The memory model prices a layer's activations from the slots, so
the records are the one source of what a layer keeps, op by op: a caller
prices any setting of the switches from them without setting the switches
on a config.

The expressions are Python arithmetic, parsed once and refused unless every
node is one of a closed set: numbers, names, the arithmetic and comparison
operators, ``and``, ``or``, ``not``, conditional expressions, and calls of
``max`` and ``min``.  A name is a field of the layer config, or one of the
names the caller binds.

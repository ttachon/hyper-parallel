"""Op profiles: the layer kinds of each known architecture family, as data.

Every file under ``op_profiles/`` names a family and declares its layer kinds.
A kind states how many times one layer runs each op the cost model prices,
the numbers the ND arch hooks used to assign in code, and two flavours from a
closed set that say how the layer is shaped:

- ``attention``: ``full`` (the default) or ``linear``, a gated-DeltaNet layer
  priced on the model's linear-attention dimensions;
- ``ffn``: ``dense`` or ``moe``, or absent to keep the model's own
  feed-forward, for families whose layers do not differ in it.

A profile with more than one kind may name a ``default``, the kind a layer
takes when nothing says otherwise; a profile with one kind defaults to it.

A profile may also state what a model of its family has when its producer
does not say: under ``run``, the run's byte widths, whether its gradients
take memory without pipeline parallelism and whether tensor parallelism
shards the activations between layers (:data:`DEFAULT_RUN` otherwise); under
``model``, an MLA family's value-head width.  The cost model's ``derive``
reads them.

A model spec names its profile with ``arch``, and may declare its own counts
in ``ops`` instead.  The cost model reads only what the spec declares.  A
producer that has nothing better than a free-text model name, such as a
MindFormers ``trainer.model_name``, falls back on :func:`infer_arch`.

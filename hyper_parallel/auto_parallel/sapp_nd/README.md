# ND: Parallelizing N Dimensions with Symbolic Estimation

ND provides symbolic search over N parallelism dimensions. It generates candidate parallel strategies, filters out-of-memory configurations with memory estimation, and ranks the remaining configurations with performance estimation.

Because both estimations are analytic, ND does not require online profiling during search. This enables exhaustive exploration, fast CPU-only search, and no dependency on the execution cluster during planning.

## Inputs

- Large language model type.
- Model hyperparameters.
- Parallel dimensions to explore.
- Hardware type and device count.
- Global batch size and memory budget.

### HyperParallel configurations (`-f hyper_v2`)

A HyperParallel `train.yaml` needs only the checkpoint and the training
sequence length. The dimensions are read from the Transformers config, so
nothing about the model is restated here:

```yaml
model:
  pretrained_model_name_or_path: /path/to/Qwen3-30B-A3B
  torch_dtype: bfloat16

dataset:
  data_transform:
    max_seq_len: 4096      # or the legacy data.max_seq_len
```

Without a sequence length ND costs the model's context limit, which for a
long-context model puts every candidate out of memory; it warns when it
falls back. `training`, `accelerator`, `fsdp_config`, `activation_checkpoint`
and `context` are accepted but optional: the search varies those dimensions
itself, and the device count, batch size and memory budget come from `-d`,
`-b` and `-M`. Give them only when costing one fixed strategy.

### Search configurations (`-s`)

`-s` adds what the CLI cannot express: a candidate list per dimension, pinned
degrees, and a `resolved.yaml` written back for the trainer. A search config
either restates the model itself (see `auto_parallel/examples/*_search.yaml`)
or points at a train.yaml:

```yaml
train_yaml: "./train.yaml"
cluster:
  num_nodes: 4
  cards_per_node: 16     # optional: defaults to the -A device type
  device_memory_gb: 58.0
parallelism:
  tp: 4                  # scalar -> fixed
  pp: [1, 2, 4, 8]       # list   -> search candidates
  dp: auto               # auto   -> the searcher decides
constraint:
  global_batch_size: 128
  memory_limit_gb: 58.0  # candidates above this are dropped
recompute: "full"
```

Both are run the same way:

```bash
python -m hyper_parallel.auto_parallel.sapp_nd.nd.run_nd     -y train.yaml -s search.yaml -f hyper_v2     -d 64 -b 128 -A A3 -M 58GB -o out
```

## Workflow

1. Construct the model.

   ND selects the model and layer types from the framework configuration by default, or from the `--model` option. Tensor shapes, data types, and model-specific features are filled from the model hyperparameters.

2. Construct the parallelism space.

   The search space is constructed from the dimensions passed with `-l`. Each dimension must satisfy its own constraints and must be compatible with the device number passed with `-d` and global batch size passed with `-b`.

3. Filter out-of-memory configurations.

   Memory filtering is delegated to `memory_estimation/`. See `memory_estimation/README.md` for the memory estimator interface and supported model details.

4. Rank configurations by performance.

   Remaining configurations are ranked by `perf_estimation/`.

## Usage

Run the ND entrypoint as a Python module from the repository root:

```bash
python -m hyper_parallel.auto_parallel.sapp_nd.nd.run_nd \
    -y <mindformers_yaml> \
    -l DP MP PP EP MB MBS \
    -d 1024 \
    -b 2048 \
    -t 10
```

This example varies data parallelism, model or tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, expert parallelism, micro-batch number, and micro-batch size. The `-d` option fixes the total number of devices, `-b` fixes the global batch size, and `-t` controls how many top configurations are printed.

In HyperParallel, the ND module should be imported as:

```python
from hyper_parallel.auto_parallel.sapp_nd import nd
```

The command prints valid configurations, the subset fitting the memory budget, the top ranked strategies, and timing for search and ordering. From verbosity level 2, ND can also generate debug CSV files and plots.

## Command Options

```text
python -m hyper_parallel.auto_parallel.sapp_nd.nd.run_nd
    -y YAML_CONFIG
    [-d DEVICES]
    [-b GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE]
    [-m MODEL]
    [-l [DIMENSIONS ...]]
    [-v VERBOSITY]
    [-A DEVICE_TYPE]
    [-mppb | --manual_pipeline_balance]
    [-t TOP_CONFIG_NUMBER]
    [-mem MEM_FOR_PPB]
```

- `-y`, `--yaml_config`: path to the framework yaml configuration file.
- `-d`, `--devices`: number of devices. If omitted, ND uses the yaml value.
- `-b`, `--global_batch_size`: global batch size. If omitted, ND uses the yaml value.
- `-m`, `--model`: model name. If omitted, ND uses the yaml value.
- `-l`, `--dimensions`: parallel dimensions to vary.
- `-v`, `--verbosity`: verbosity in range `[0, 6]`.
- `-A`, `--device_type`: device type, such as `A2` or `A3`.
- `-mppb`, `--manual_pipeline_balance`: read offset and recompute from yaml.
- `-t`, `--top_config_number`: number of top configurations to print and plot.
- `-mem`, `--mem_for_ppb`: memory reserved for pipeline balancing.

## Notes

The original toolkit also contains validation scripts, result CSV files, yaml examples, DSL utilities, regression utilities, and PPB code. Those assets are not part of this SAPP-ND PR2 package. Pipeline balancing is maintained separately in the SAPP-PPB module.

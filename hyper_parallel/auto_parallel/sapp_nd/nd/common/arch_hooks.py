"""A model's family, applied to its config, and its layer kinds.

A family is data: its op profile in ``auto_parallel/op_profiles``, or the op
counts its model spec declares, chosen by ``ccfg.arch``, which the parser
settles, never by matching the model name.  :func:`check_and_apply_custom_hook`
applies it where the estimators price a config: what the family decides
where the run states nothing (:func:`derive_family`), then the op counts of
its default kind.

The layer stack is data too (``ccfg.layer_stack``).  The estimators read each
layer's kind from :func:`layer_groups`, and :func:`apply_layer_kind` gives a
layer its kind from the fields :func:`bind_layer_stack` recorded when the
family was applied.  A family whose layers take some fields per layer rather
than on the model, cm's sharding, leaves them in ``ccfg.layer_fields`` for
every kind to assign.

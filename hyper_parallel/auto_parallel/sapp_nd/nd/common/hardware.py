class HostLink:
    """How fast a device moves activations to its host's memory and back, as offload prices it.

    A3's bandwidth below is measured; every other figure is an assumption.
    Measure a link with every die of a job copying at once, as
    ``nd_golden/offload/bench_host_link.py`` does, since a job copies at its
    slowest die, and state it here or with ``run_nd --host_link_gibps``.

    Attributes:
        gib_per_s: The sustained copy bandwidth between the device and
            pinned host memory, in GiB/s, with one copy stream carrying both
            directions, as hyper_offload and the trainer's input swap run it.
        sustained_tflops: The device's sustained dense throughput at the
            training precision, in TFLOP/s, which turns a copy's seconds into
            the performance estimate's units where no calibration states
            how long one unit takes.
        overlap: The share of the forward time the copy stream may take:
            1 where the copies meet nothing, less where the step's compute
            or its collectives share what the copies need. 0.8 is an
            assumption; ``run_nd --host_link_overlap`` states another.
        ms_per_unit: The milliseconds one unit of the forward the
            performance estimate prices stands for: a calibration round's
            FORWARD ratio where it measured the forward on its own, else its
            COMPUTE ratio. Stated, it turns a copy's seconds into the
            estimate's units in place of *sustained_tflops*: the estimate
            counts a step's matmul FLOPs, a fraction of its work, so a
            device rate makes every forward look several times shorter than
            it runs; and it may split the forward from the backward
            otherwise than the device does, so that COMPUTE can make the
            forward the copies hide in look longer.

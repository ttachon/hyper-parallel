"""Recompute as a dimension of the search: the activation checkpoint modes a candidate may run.

A parallel degree is stated as one value, a list of candidates or ``auto``,
and the recompute dimension is stated the same way: ``full``, ``[off, full]``
or ``auto``. Its values are HyperParallel's activation checkpoint modes. The
search prices every candidate under each mode the dimension allows and ranks
the pairs together, each with its own memory check, so a mode left out of the
list is never proposed: selective, say, which the estimate prices as a policy
that runs well would run, while HyperParallel's own selective path runs
slower than full recompute.

The degrees are integers whose product is the device count, which the search
enumerates together; a mode is no factor of it, so the search runs once per
mode instead (:meth:`ParallelizeLayer.run_generation_to_ordering`).

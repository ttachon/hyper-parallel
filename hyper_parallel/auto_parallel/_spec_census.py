"""The census's ModelSpec: a model's stack, dimensions and op counts, measured on the layers it builds.

The resolver (:mod:`hyper_parallel.auto_parallel._hf_model_spec`) states a
model from its Transformers config's field names, completed by rules a
family's name selects.  The census states it from the model Transformers
builds of the config instead, the block walk of IR phase 5:

- every decoder layer is built on the meta device, and its attention and
  feed-forward are told apart by what they hold: a gated delta rule makes
  a linear attention, routed experts a MoE feed-forward;
- one layer of each shape runs a forward on fake tensors, under the
  kernels the runtime runs (:mod:`~hyper_parallel.auto_parallel._layer_census`),
  and the kernels' inputs state its heads and their widths, the router's
  top-k its experts per token;
- the parameters state the widths, the biases, the norms and the gates.

A layer's op counts are counted in ND's units: an attention's projections
by role, the queries', keys' and values' the kernel takes and the output's
after it; its batched matmuls, softmaxes and score casts per softmax kernel;
a feed-forward's projections as its weights over one ``h x width``
projection's; its norms and activation functions as the modules it runs.
The kinds are the model's family's (``arch``), each layer taking the kind
whose flavours its own match, and :func:`census_model_spec` states the whole
as a ModelSpec mapping, the resolver's form, which a train.yaml's
``model.config_overrides`` takes as it is.

"""The execution IR: how a model is trained, beside what the model is.

:class:`~hyper_parallel.auto_parallel._model_spec.ModelSpec` states the facts
about an architecture that hold whatever strategy it runs under.
:class:`ExecSpec` states the rest: what a search varies (the parallel
degrees, the micro-batching, the sharding and the recompute policy) and the
fixed facts of the run (the sequence length, the precisions, the kernels and
the device's memory).  The cost model derives everything else from the two.

It follows the model spec's two rules.  **Absent is not zero**: every field
defaults to ``None``, which means "not stated", so an ExecSpec can state a
whole run or only what a search candidate changes, and a consumer never
mistakes an unstated degree for a degree of zero.  **Refuse rather than
default**: :meth:`ExecSpec.validate` rejects a stated value that cannot be
right, and :meth:`ExecSpec.from_dict` refuses a key it does not know, by name.

    byte width, ``grad_accumulation`` or ``shard_activations`` that no spec
    states takes the default of the model's family, from its op profile.

    Attributes:
        dp, tp, pp, vpp, cp, ep: The data, tensor, pipeline, virtual
            pipeline, context and expert parallel degrees.
        etp: The expert tensor-parallel degree; at most 1 means an expert
            layer runs with the dense layers' tensor parallelism.
        sequence_parallel: Whether activations are split along the sequence
            over the tensor-parallel group.
        shard_activations: Whether tensor parallelism shards the activations
            between layers, which a fully recomputed layer keeps as its
            input, and the output layer's.
        micro_batch_size, micro_batch_num, global_batch_size: The batch.
        optimizer_parallel: Whether optimizer states are sharded.
        optimizer_shard: How many data-parallel ranks optimizer sharding
            splits each parameter over, on top of TP's split, as MindSpore's
            ``optimizer_weight_shard_size`` and HyperParallel's ``dp_shard``
            count them.
        expert_shard: How many ranks of its expert data-parallel group FSDP
            shards a routed expert over under expert parallelism, as
            HyperParallel's ``edp_shard_size`` counts them; without expert
            parallelism the experts shard with the other parameters.  Stated
            by no one, the optimizer shards them over the whole group.
        grad_shard: Whether gradients are sharded too.
        grad_shard_as_params: Whether each gradient is sharded as its
            parameter is, as FSDP holds it; ``grad_shard`` does not apply.
        grad_accumulation: Whether gradients take memory without pipeline
            parallelism too; under it they always do.
        deferred_grad_accumulation: Whether FSDP holds each layer's
            reduce-scatter output until the micro-batch's backward ends, and
            only then adds it to the accumulated gradient, as HyperParallel's
            does; PyTorch's FSDP2 adds it as soon as it is reduced.
        overlapped_grad_reduce: Whether FSDP reduce-scatters a layer's
            gradients while the next layer's backward runs, holding them
            whole until that one ends, and the root's, the embedding and
            output tables', until the backward ends, as HyperParallel's does.
        reshard_params: Whether FSDP frees a layer's gathered parameters
            once the layer has run, forward or backward, and gathers them
            again when it runs next, as HyperParallel's does by default;
            the root's, the embedding and output tables, stay gathered.
        pp_schedule: The pipeline schedule, such as ``1f1b``.
        offset: How many layers each pipeline stage holds beyond an even
            split, per stage or per chunk and stage.
        seq_split: How many parts a sequence is split into for a sequence
            pipeline.
        pp_partition: The layers each stage holds, when stated outright.
        mtp_in_offset, emb_out_in_offset: Whether the MTP layers, and the
            embedding and output layers, count in the offset's layers.
        full_recompute, selective_recompute: Which layers are recomputed in
            full or selectively: true for all, or counts per stage.
        recompute: How each layer recomputes, as :class:`RecomputeRange`
            ranges over the layers in model order.  Stated, it replaces the
            per-stage forms above; a layer no range covers is not
            recomputed.
        selective_comm_recompute: Which layers recompute their
            sequence-parallel all-gather, under the MindFormers rule.
        selective_rule: Whose selective recompute the run uses, one of
            :data:`SELECTIVE_RULES`.
        recompute_slice_activation: Whether a recomputed layer keeps its
            input sliced over tensor parallelism.
        param_bytes, compute_bytes, softmax_bytes, grad_bytes,
            optimizer_state_bytes, norm_bytes, dropout_bytes: Bytes per
            element of the parameters, activations, softmax outputs,
            gradients, optimizer states, norm activations and dropout masks.
        optimizer_states: How many states the optimizer keeps per parameter
            of a layer: AdamW's two moments, or Muon's one momentum.  The
            embedding and output tables keep AdamW's two.
        main_param_bytes: Bytes per element of the copy of the parameters
            the optimizer keeps, 0 when it keeps none, as HyperParallel's
            fp32 main parameters keep one.
        flash_attention, grad_clip, grouped_gemm, tie_embeddings: Kernels
            and features the run uses.
        vocab_emb_dp: Whether the vocabulary embedding runs data parallel.
        emb_dp_sharded: Whether the embedding table is sharded over data
            parallelism.
        cp_algo: The context-parallel algorithm.
        capacity_factor: The experts' token capacity factor.
        shard_mtp_param: Whether the MTP layers' parameters are sharded.
        frozen: Whether the model's parameters are frozen.
        optimizer: The optimizer's name.
        seq_length: The training sequence length.
        device_memory: The device's memory, such as ``"64GB"``.

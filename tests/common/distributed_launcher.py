"""Lightweight helpers to spawn ``torchrun`` workers.

These helpers must **not** import ``torch``, ``torch_npu``, or any training
framework. Pytest launchers and ``parallel_case`` run in a parent / wrapper
process that only needs to exec the distributed runner; pulling heavy
frameworks into that process pays startup cost twice (parent + workers) and
can inflate ST wall time.

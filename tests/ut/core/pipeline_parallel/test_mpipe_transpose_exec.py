"""Single-process tests for the MPipe Transpose execution math.

These validate the core numerical invariant of the schedule without any
distributed runtime: the (uniform, always-detached) preprocess forward -> body
forward/backward -> stage-0 backward path must produce exactly the same
preprocess gradient as an ordinary graph-connected forward/backward. Since the
round-robin change every micro currently takes the detached path (the old
graph-connected inline path for overflow micros was dropped); the stage-0
backward recomputes the grad instead. The in-flight owner-does-backward work
retains the forward graph on the owner and will reconnect it -- tracked by the
``test_preprocess_output_stays_graph_connected`` xfail below.

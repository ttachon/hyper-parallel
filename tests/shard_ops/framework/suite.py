# pure labels — placements act by axis index and the fn never reads names. We

# same topology but different cosmetic naming (e.g. ("sp",) vs ("dp",), or
# ("dp","mp") vs ("dp","tp")) share ONE bucket/launcher instead of splitting
# into extra serial batches. Each launcher startup costs ~50s (NPU/CANN init),

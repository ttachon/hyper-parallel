# HyperParallel

An Ascend SuperPod-affinity distributed parallel acceleration library that simplifies supernode programming and
unleashes computational potential.

HyperParallel provides Ascend SuperPod-affinity distributed parallel acceleration capabilities. Whilst maintaining ease
of use, it addresses the architectural characteristics of Ascend SuperPods, including resource pooling, peer-to-peer
architecture, hierarchical and diverse network topology, and FP8 low-precision formats. It implements distributed
parallelism from cluster level to multi-core parallelism within chips, supports unified pooled management of CPU DRAM
and NPU HBM, topology-aware scheduling and communication path planning, and FP8 mixed-precision training amongst other
Ascend SuperPod-affinity acceleration capabilities.

Key design principles:

**Decoupling of Model and System Optimisation**: With the continuous evolution of LLM and multimodal algorithm
architectures, performance optimisation techniques have also been advancing. The traditional integrated architecture of
algorithm and system optimisation poses challenges for algorithm iteration and long-term system maintenance.
HyperParallel supports evolving the programming model from system optimisation embedded within model scripts to a
decoupled model and system optimisation approach, with implicit injection of parallelism, recomputation, offload and
other system optimisations. It supports the evolution of parallel paradigms from SPMD to MPMD, further supporting
coordinated optimisation of cluster MPMD and multi-core MPMD. It supports the evolution of compute-storage relationships
from Stateful to Stateless with separated computation and state, as well as large language model training, multimodal
large model training, and reinforcement learning capabilities.

**End-to-End Determinism**: To further ensure training stability and precision reproducibility, HyperParallel supports
end-to-end determinism, including high-performance deterministic computation, communication, data preprocessing, and
random number determinism, supporting floating-point bitwise alignment. All supported models are validated using
determinism. Although there is some performance degradation, enabling determinism during training remains recommended
for precision reproducibility, rapid SDC detection, and bug identification.

**Unified Training and Inference**: As Reasoning RL and Agentic RL tasks become increasingly complex, the
training-inference inconsistency problem causing reinforcement learning training convergence difficulties has become
more prominent. HyperParallel will explore a unified training-inference architecture, achieving performance optimisation
for both training and inference through a single acceleration framework, strengthening training-inference consistency
and ensuring RL convergence.

**Hybrid Dynamic-Static Execution**: Optimisation based on static graphs is an important means of further improving
performance. For instance, capabilities such as compute-communication concurrency, memory analysis, and execution
sequence orchestration based on static graphs can effectively optimise performance, which are not easily achievable in
dynamic graph mode. However, dynamic-to-static compilation support is extremely challenging, and complete
dynamic-to-static conversion is not yet achievable. HyperParallel will support partial dynamic-to-static conversion
through certain syntax constraints, utilising advanced graph optimisation capabilities to further enhance performance.

## Installation Guide

HyperParallel offers two installation methods:

- **pip installation**: install an already built `hyper-parallel` package and use extras to select runtime deep
  learning framework dependencies.
- **source build**: use `./build.sh` to generate a whl package, and use build arguments to decide whether native
  extensions are compiled.

If you only need to install a released package, prefer `pip install`. If you need to generate a whl package locally or
customize native extension build options, build from source.

### 1. Install With pip

`pip install` extras only control Python runtime dependencies. They do not control native extension compilation.

| Command                                   | Installed dependencies                                          | Use case                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pip install hyper-parallel`              | Common dependencies only, no deep learning framework            | You manage framework versions yourself or only use framework-independent features |
| `pip install 'hyper-parallel[torch]'`     | Common dependencies + `torch==2.9.1` + `torch-npu==2.9.1`       | Use the default PyTorch 2.9 backend                                               |
| `pip install 'hyper-parallel[torch26]'`   | Common dependencies + `torch==2.6.0` + `torch-npu==2.6.0.post3` | Use the PyTorch 2.6 backend                                                       |
| `pip install 'hyper-parallel[torch27]'`   | Common dependencies + `torch==2.7.1` + `torch-npu==2.7.1`       | Use the PyTorch 2.7 backend                                                       |
| `pip install 'hyper-parallel[torch29]'`   | Common dependencies + `torch==2.9.1` + `torch-npu==2.9.1`       | Explicitly use the PyTorch 2.9 backend                                            |
| `pip install 'hyper-parallel[all]'`       | Common dependencies + default PyTorch 2.9                       | Use the default PyTorch backend                                                   |

In shells such as zsh, quote package names with extras so `[]` is not treated as a glob pattern.

### 2. Build a Wheel From Source

The common build entry invokes the selected component build scripts and assembles one wheel.
The indexed Dataset C++ helper is built on every invocation. Multicore includes its private
SHMEM dependency and therefore has no separate SHMEM build option.

| Argument       | Default                         | Values     | Description                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `--multicore`  | `on`                            | `on`, `off` | Build the Torch Multicore component and SHMEM.   |
| `--soc-list`   | `ascend910b,ascend910_93`       | SoC list   | Select the Multicore kernel targets.             |
| `--strict`     | `off`                           | `on`, `off` | Stop if a selected optional component fails.     |
| `--jobs`       | `nproc`                         | Integer    | Set native compilation parallelism.              |
| `--clean`      | disabled                        | Flag       | Rebuild selected component work and install data. |

```bash
./build.sh --help
./build.sh --multicore on --soc-list ascend910b,ascend910_93
./build.sh --strict on --jobs 24
pip install /absolute/path/to/the-built-wheel.whl
```

Generic prerequisites are Python 3.10–3.12, Python development headers, setuptools,
wheel, pybind11 and a C++17 host toolchain. SDK, framework and device constraints
are component-specific. A wheel targets one Python ABI and host architecture;
its runtime must satisfy the framework ABI and the ELF glibc requirements.

See the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) for packaging details and the
Multicore CANN custom OPP activation procedure.

## Quick Start

1. Use `fully_shard` for data-parallel parameter sharding

```python
from hyper_parallel import fully_shard, init_device_mesh

mesh = init_device_mesh(device_type="npu", mesh_shape=(dp_size,), mesh_dim_names=("dp",))
model = fully_shard(model, mesh=mesh)
```

2. Use declarative TP Styles for tensor parallelism

```python
from hyper_parallel import ColwiseParallel, RowwiseParallel, parallelize_module, init_device_mesh

tp_mesh = init_device_mesh("npu", (tp_size,), mesh_dim_names=("tp",))

parallelize_module(
    model,
    tp_mesh,
    {
        "attn.q_proj": ColwiseParallel(),
        "attn.k_proj": ColwiseParallel(),
        "attn.v_proj": ColwiseParallel(),
        "attn.o_proj": RowwiseParallel(),
        "mlp.gate_proj": ColwiseParallel(),
        "mlp.up_proj": ColwiseParallel(),
        "mlp.down_proj": RowwiseParallel(),
    },
)
```

4. Use `PipelineStage` and `PipelineSchedule` for pipeline parallelism

```python
from hyper_parallel import DTensor
from hyper_parallel.core.pipeline_parallel import PipelineStage, Schedule1F1B

# Wrap the partitioned module into PipelineStage
stage = PipelineStage(split_model, stage_index, stage_num=4)

# Select pipeline parallel scheduling
schedule = Schedule1F1B(stage, micro_batch_num=8)

# Execute
x = DTensor.from_local(local_x, input_mesh, input_placements)
schedule.run(x)
```

5. Use Optimizer for Muon+AdamW chained optimisation

```python
from hyper_parallel.core.optimizer import get_hyper_optimizer

optimizer = get_hyper_optimizer(
    model=model,
    muon_params=muon_param_groups,
    adamw_params=adamw_param_groups,
    muon_kwargs={"lr": 0.02, "momentum": 0.95},
    adamw_kwargs={"lr": 3e-4, "weight_decay": 0.1},
)
```

6. Use Activation Checkpoint/Swap for memory optimisation

```python
from hyper_parallel.core.activation_checkpoint import checkpoint_wrapper, swap_wrapper

model.layers[0] = checkpoint_wrapper(model.layers[0])
model.layers[1] = swap_wrapper(model.layers[1])
```

# Measure DeepSeek-V4.1 step times REPEATEDLY and WITHOUT the profiler, so the
# strategies can be ranked on something the measurement can resolve.
#
# Why this exists rather than the stock run script:
#
#   The seven points measured on 1 and 5 October were each run once, under the
#   profiler, and ranked on the mean of profiled steps 3 and 4. The whole gap
#   being argued over is 152.6 ms, 1.9% of a step. The same strategy measured
#   twice gave 8268.0 and 8173.4 ms, 1.2% apart. On Qwen3.5 the Ascend profiler
#   costs 0.33 to 0.84 s a step at EP 1 and 0.01 to 0.10 at EP 8, which is a
#   third of the gap and runs the same way as the comparison, and the same
#   strategy repeated UNPROFILED reproduced to 0.013%. So the ordering of those
#   seven points is not sound evidence either way, and this script buys the two
#   things that would make it sound: no instrument, and a spread per strategy.
#
#   run_deepseek_v41_online.sh cannot be used for this. It tees every run of a
#   mode to output/training_demo/deepseek_v41/run_<mode>.log, so repeated tp1
#   runs overwrite each other and only the last survives, and the launcher it
#   reads states train_iters: 1, which leaves no step to harvest.
#
# What it does NOT do: rank anything. It writes raw rows and nothing else, so
# every number is derived off the device from saved output, which is also how
# ND is kept out of the trainer's tree.
#
# Usage:
#   ./repeat_deepseek_v41_runs.sh /path/to/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash
#
#   POINTS="1:1 1:2"  ./repeat_deepseek_v41_runs.sh <model>   # a subset
#   REPEATS=1         ./repeat_deepseek_v41_runs.sh <model>   # one pass first
#   EDP_SHARD=1       ./repeat_deepseek_v41_runs.sh <model>   # see the note below
#
# Interrupted runs: launch it again with the same RUN_ROOT and it skips every
# point already recorded, so a window that closes early can be continued.

# Six is a CEILING, not a preference, and step 7 dies on every strategy:
# prepare_deepseek_v41_online_data.py writes documents of 24 tokens times 1024
# repetitions plus one, 24577, which is 6 x 4096 + 1, so PlaintextTransform
# cuts each document into six full 4096-token pieces and a ONE-TOKEN tail (the
# appended EOS). Documents 0 to 15 give exactly 96 full pieces, which is six
# steps at a batch of 16, and their sixteen one-token tails stay buffered until
# step 7. There cu_seq_lens carries a boundary of 1, and the V4.1 attention
# refuses it: "packed sample boundaries must align with the CSA2 compression
# ratio 2; misaligned boundaries=[1]". No generator argument avoids it, because
# a document is always 24 x repetitions + 1 tokens, which is always odd, and
# 4096 is even, so the tail is odd whatever --sequence-length is passed. Fixing
# it means padding each document to an even token count, which the generator
# cannot do without a tokenizer. Raise this only with data that has been fixed.

# Check a node before a DeepSeek-V4.1 measurement window opens.
#
# Every check here is a read: no device is allocated, nothing is launched, and
# it is safe to run while somebody else holds the node. Run it the day before
# the window, and again in its first minute.
#
# Why each check exists, from what the last round cost:
#
#   The 1 October round raised ModuleNotFoundError for omni_training_custom_ops
#   on every rank, from the sparse attention forward. V4.1 attention has no
#   torch fallback and the package has to be carried in and built per SoC, so
#   a missing one is not a five minute fix on a cluster with no internet.
#
#   That round lost 20 of its minutes to a node another process was holding,
#   and the 1 October Qwen3.5 round lost 5 of its 20 points to a process
#   holding 40 to 47 GiB on one node.
#
#   Nothing records which indexer path a run took. The launcher sets neither
#   indexer flag, the validation builder defaults fused_indexer true, and the
#   attention passes it as use_provider, which consults the provider and never
#   raises. So a run falls back to the reference indexer SILENTLY, and a
#   profile taken on the reference is not a production run's.
#
# Usage:
#   ./preflight_deepseek_v41_window.sh /path/to/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash
#
# Exit status is 0 only when every FAIL-level check passed. WARN items do not
# fail the run; they change what the window can be used for, so read them.

# Distributed Operator Analysis

## Full Distributed Operator Development Workflow

This skill is the entry point of the full workflow. The complete chain is:

```text
1. /dist-op-analysis   Analyze interfaces → output plan → STOP, wait for human confirmation
         ↓  (human confirms plan)
2. /dist-op-dev        Read plan → implement → write tests → run tests → fix until all pass
                       Verification report saved to dist-op-dev/reports/
         ↓
3. /commit  (autogit)  Lint check → commit → push to fork branch
         ↓
4. /gate-doctor        Monitor CI gate → retest flakes → fix failures → gate turns green
```

Steps 3 and 4 are standard for any PR and are not specific to distributed operators.

## Trigger

The user provides any combination of:

- PyTorch interface (e.g. `torch.nn.functional.linear`)
- The distributed-operator class name already registered for it (optional)

## Output Language

**Write the plan in Chinese.** All section headings, descriptions, constraint rules, test case names and their descriptions in the plan file must be in Chinese. Code identifiers, file paths, and YAML snippets remain in their original form.

## Step 1: Confirm the Operator

Identify the target torch interface from the user's request and **state it explicitly in the plan** (e.g. `torch.nn.functional.linear`, `torch.sort`). If the request is ambiguous — several torch entries map onto the same distributed class — name the candidates and ask the user to pick one before continuing.

## Step 2: Interface Analysis

Refer to the official PyTorch documentation for the interface signature, parameter semantics, and constraints. Extract: parameter names and order, which parameters are keyword-only (declared after `*`), dtypes, shape constraints, and known limitations.

**The plan must state** which parameters are keyword-only — they stay in `local_kwargs` — and which are positional.

## Step 3: Distributed Layout Derivation Analysis

Based on the operator semantics, analyze the following and write them into the plan:

1. **Which dimensions are naturally independent** (can be sharded): e.g. batch, head, sequence
2. **Which dimensions cannot be sharded**: e.g. reduce dim, rotation dim
3. **Broadcast and shard constraints for auxiliary inputs** (e.g. cos/sin)
4. **Derived inputs**: does the op consume tensors derived from primaries via a device op over global info (e.g. attention `sm_max/sm_sum`)? If so, the ST plan must declare them as `derived_inputs` (computed once on full tensors, then sliced) — not faked, not recomputed in-fn. See `.agent/rules/distributed-op-testing.md`.
5. **Output layout derivation rule**: deepcopy(input), new layout, or Partial
6. **Whether `get_expand_impl` is needed**: required when distributed result differs from single-device result
7. **`cache_values` composition**: Layout objects first, then scalars; only include information that affects layout inference
8. **Allowed shard scenarios**: list valid scenarios in a table (mesh, tensor_map per input); invalid scenarios are described in the constraint rules section, not in this table

## Step 4: Implementation Design

Design file paths and content skeletons following `templates/plan-template.md`:

### 4.0 Base Class Selection (must be stated in the plan)

Evaluate in order and explicitly state the choice and rationale in the plan:

1. **YAML-only registration** (no new Python file): operator has purely element-wise semantics (output shape = broadcast of inputs, any dimension can be independently sharded) — add an entry to an existing YAML file, reusing `ElementWiseDistributedOp` or `ElementWiseWithPartialDistributedOp`.
2. **Inherit an existing base class**: operator semantics are close to an existing base class but need minor customization (e.g. adding per-op dtype routing, extra validation) — subclass the nearest base class and override only what differs.
   - `ElementWiseDistributedOp` / `ElementWiseWithPartialDistributedOp` — element-wise
   - `TupleElementWiseDistributedOp` — element-wise with tuple inputs/outputs
   - `ReshapeDistributedOp` — changes shape without rearranging data
3. **New class + three-phase dispatch**: when no existing base class fits — create a new class implementing `preprocess → infer_layout(cache_values) → get_expand_impl`.

**Must NOT** create a new class directly from `DistributedOp` when an existing specialized base class covers the operator's layout semantics.

### 4.1 File and Interface Design

Key requirements:

- **`_validate_input_layouts`**: only required for new classes using three-phase dispatch; defined as `@staticmethod`, called by `infer_layout` after `_check_partial_inputs`. Performs layout validity checks only (sharding constraints, mesh consistency, etc.) — no derivation.
- **PyTorch ST**: cases use standard `torch.xxx()` APIs. Cases are defined in `tests/torch/shard/ops/cases/case_{op_name}.py` using the declarative `OpShardCase` pattern. See `.agent/rules/distributed-op-testing.md` for the full spec.

## Step 5: Output the Plan

Save the plan to:

```text
hyper-parallel/.agent/skills/dist-op-analysis/plans/{OpName}_dist_op_plan.md
```

This directory is excluded by `.gitignore` and will not be committed.

Fill in the complete plan following `templates/plan-template.md`, then **stop and wait for user confirmation**. Do not begin any code development.

If there is any ambiguity (Primitive name cannot be determined, kwonlyargs need verification), mark the item as `[待确认]` in the plan — do not guess.
